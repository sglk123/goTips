need to call interface struct methods which is not published

for example 
  type sglk struct {
         age int 
         grade int
  }

  func (s *sglk) Raise() {
   s.grade++
  }

  func (s *sglk) Grow() {
     s.age++
  }

  type Person interface {
    Raise()
  }

when u want to call grow, here is the solution 
  Person.(interface {
   Grow()
  })
